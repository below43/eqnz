# eqnz

EQNZ.nz was built post Sep 4 2010 #chch quake in ÅŒtautahi / Christchurch in Aotearoa / New Zealand in order to monitor the [#eqnz](https://twitter.com/hashtag/eqnz?lang=en "#eqnz Twitter hashtag") Twitter hashtag and [civil defence](https://twitter.com/NZcivildefence) and [geonet](https://twitter.com/geonet) tweets.

In May 2023 Elon Musk shut the API down so we can longer provide the eqnz service.

Instead, the site now shows a very shakey nz.
