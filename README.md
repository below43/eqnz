# eqnz

[EQNZ.nz](https://eqnz.nz) was built post Sep 4 2010 #chch quake in ÅŒtautahi / Christchurch in Aotearoa / New Zealand in order to monitor the [#eqnz](https://twitter.com/hashtag/eqnz?lang=en "#eqnz Twitter hashtag") Twitter hashtag and [civil defence](https://twitter.com/NZcivildefence) and [geonet](https://twitter.com/geonet) tweets.

In May 2023 Elon Musk shut the API down so we were no longer able provide the eqnz service via Twitter.

Instead, the site was updated to show a very shakey nz.

In December, 2024 the site was updated to aggregate Blue Sky posts.
